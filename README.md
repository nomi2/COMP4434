1. X_train is the dataset of attributes, indicates the information about lung cells.
2. Y_train is the dataset of labels, indicates the diagnosis, malignant (1) or benign (0).  
3. The model should contain the idea of logistic regression and regularization
4. Logistic Regression has to be implemented by yourselves.
5. Please use X_train and Y_train to train your model and  use X_test to predict the Y_pre. Then upload your Y_pre as a csv file, choose ',' as the delimiter,  into the BB. 
6. The Y_pre file should be named as Name_StudentID.csv, no capital characters. (zhangsan_123456789d.csv)
7. The Y_pre file of bonus model (Neural Networks) should be named as nn_Name_StudentID.csv.(nn_zhangsan_123456789d.csv)
8. Please upload your model as a executable python file, name rule is the same, Name_StudentID.py. (zhangsan_123456789d.py)
